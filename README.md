## Notes to myself

27.01.21

1.  **Refactor** the code after you gain more experience in mobile development. As my first complex app, the code above probably contains some deadly programmer mistakes and terrible practices. Instead of abandoning it, fix it. Dealing with bad code is as important a skill as writing good code.

2.  **Study design patterns** again.

3.  The lack of **unit testing** is the biggest shortcoming of this project. Test everything from now on.

4.  **Be collaborative** next time. Working alone sure forces you to learn a lot, but nothing beats collective work.
